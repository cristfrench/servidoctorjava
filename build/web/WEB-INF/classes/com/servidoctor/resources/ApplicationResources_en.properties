7500= <B><a name\="0000"><br><br> INTRODUCTION </a></B><BR><BR><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> The cats, are animal well-known for their hunter spirit, astute and elegant. Their race gives some parameters to know what the character of our cat will be like, but each cat no matter that they are of the same breed, will be different. In the moment that we know the character and personality of our cat, we will be able to know what we have to keep in mind so the cat will be comfortable in our home. The cats are clean animals and they usually adapt easily to an owner and a determined home and they are considered to be one of the best company animals. </P>

7502= <I> It is always important to know about the health and age of the cat we will acquire. </I> 
7503= <B><a name\="0002"><br><br> AT WHAT AGE IS IT ADVISABLE TO HAVE IT </a></B><BR><BR><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> There are certain things that you should keep in mind when deciding between a young cat and an adult one. In the very young cats it should be kept in mind that it is necessary to have left them minimum a month and half with their mother so that they receive milk of her, which is necessary, and learn behaviors that will be fundamental in their lives. Additionally, due to the age, their defenses are very low and this makes him to have more risk of acquiring any illness. <br> The mature cats, contrary to the young ones, have high defenses what makes them stronger to different diseases and they already have an established routine for their cleaning. They are less restless than the young cats and in time they can adapt to new places. </P> 
7504= <B><a name\="0003"> KNOWING HOW TO CHOOSE A CAT FROM A LITTER </a></B><BR><BR><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> Apart from knowing everything about the health of your cat, you should keep in mind that its hair has the same tone, brilliant and without any damage; the ears, the eyes and the anus must be clean at first sight because if they are not, some infection or illness might be present. <br> In the same way we should keep in mind the cat\u00B4s humor; if it is very aggressive it can be for shyness; the cat should usually be very playful and shows a lot of movement or activity if we request it. <br> It is important to know that white cats with blue eyes, could be possibly deaf. </P> 
7505= <B><a name\="0004"> THEIR FEEDING </a></B><BR><BR><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> Once the cat has been weaned from its mother to the month and half of life, it should maintain a complete and balanced feeding of high quality during the following months. The cats, in spite of the generalities, should not be fed with leftovers of food, because in their diet there would be a lack of amino acids and vitamins. <BR> It is fundamental that they go <B> by the stage of suckling </B> . It is an instinctive act and it produces them a change in the behavior whose lack will be very accused in those that don\u00B4t make it. These are less playful cats, more capricious with the food and they tend "to suckle" objects or our hands constantly.

As soon as three colors appear it is because they have joined the couple of chromosomes X of the female and the male\u00B4s X. <BR><br> <b> \u00BFHow is the "purr" of the cats produced? </b> <BR> They are many people who wonder how the cat is able of emitting this sound so characteristic. It seems to start in the larynx, but many scientists aim the possibility that it might be produced by the vibration of the blood in a great vein located in the thoracic box. <BR><br> <b> Do you know why the cats Siamese all of uniform color are born and with the time their ends begin to be darkened until obtaining their habitual layer? </b> <BR> The answer is the difference of temperature that they posses, which disables in the hottest areas a precursor of the melanin (a pigment responsible for the dark color) that will appear in the ends two or three colder grades which are the dark parts of the cat. <BR><br> <b> Who was Bastet? <BR> She was a goddess-cat that the Egyptians adored.

That is why we should have information about every breed characteristics (or the ones of the breeds we are more interested in) so we could make the right choice.  The size of the dog depends on its breed, so if we don\u00B4t know about it would be a long term trouble.

In this case it is convenient to know what and why is going on with the dog.  Because of the zeal, some females can urinate more frequently and they could suffer hormonal dysfunctions. <br><b> The Male </b>  because of its nature, could be same or more loving than a female of the same breed, but in general they tend to be more territorial and need to mark differences with other male dogs.  An age always arrives that usually coincides with the end of its development, in which its hormones appear and they will define in a high percentage its behavior.

They are the nutrients and they contribute the basic amino acids, so we will provide them appropriately. <br><br> The puppy must stay with its mother for at least <b> 40 days </b>  after the birth, because during this period she is his food source, protection and education.  In those cases in those that the circumstances prevent the mother to breastfeed them, you can appeal another dog that will make nurse\u00B4s times. In general, she won\u00B4t have problems in accepting the puppy, and it is achieved this way that their only food is the maternal milk. This milk is, without a doubt, the most appropriate to transmit the necessary nutrients and the immunity of necessary defense in to the external world. <br>  Whenever it is possible, the time of being suckled should prolong during one month or month and half. It will depend on the number of puppies of the litter and of their size. Once they go growing, the dog (mother) tends to reject them for the damage that their small teeth cause in the mammary gland. <br><br> We should keep in mind that the feeding of the dog should not be based only in the meat consumption or, in consequence, in the consumption of meat proteins. The dog is omnivorous and the vegetable foods contribute with proteins that should be part of it is diet. <br> There are different proteins, as certain essential amino acids for the development of the dog, which are not synthesized by the metabolism of the animal. Pay attention to the foods that contain a great amount of essential amino acids, what we could check in the labels of the products; we will also make sure that they guarantee a complete diet. The nutritious needs of the dog are not the same ones in each stage of the life. For example The old dog\u00B4s need more quantity of proteins, for what we should know, according to the ages, the different needs so we could give our dog the appropriate feeding. </p><br>

We should be watchful if the dog loses weight during the first months because it wouldn\u00B4t be a healthy animal. In general, it is considered that after a week the puppy should pass its weight from birth and starts adding kilos until it reaches the characteristic measures of the race. </p></li><li><u><p align\="justify">  Mood </u><br> If the animal ends its food and looks happy and playful, there should be no problem. If the puppy cries constantly and it is hyperactive, something can be wrong.  Such an attitude in a not one month old yet puppy shows problems and in that case you must immediately to the veterinarian. </p></li><li><u><p align\="justify"> Feces </u><br> At the beginning, we could see that making any change in the feeding can make the consistence of the feces change too.  Once we have settled down the right feeding, the feces must not change.  The diarrheas occur by several reasons and if they persist during long time it is necessary to go to the veterinarian. </p></li><li><u><p align\="justify"> The quantity of the food </u><br> For each dog there is always a relationship between the quantity of food, the age and the weight (it is not that the races of big dog\u00B4s eat twice as much that the small ones, the proportion is different). The way of feeding them varies regarding the age; to smaller age more times to the day and more age, less times. <br>  With those dog\u00B4s that are calm and leisurely to eat, it is possible to leave them in their plate so they can administer their food themselves, but when they are gluttonous and anxious it is better to give them the fair quantity, since it is not good for them to eat too much. <br> An advantage of administering yourself the food is to have the opportunity to program the going outs and with it, a better education for the dog. <br> In case you cannot be pending during the day of the foods of the puppy, leave exactly the quantity of daily food that should ingest. At the beginning, the puppy will find difficult to eat in solitude, but little by little it will make it. <br> With the age, the dog\u00B4s begin to suffer different nutritious dysfunctions, for what would be convenient to give them senior food, because this kind of food give them the necessary nutrients and diminishes those that the dog\u00B4s don\u00B4t need anymore or that produce them problems. <br><br> If you will change the food of your dog, don\u00B4t do it suddenly. It is better if you do it mixing the foods so that the animal gets used.

Their period of incubation oscillates between ten days and the three weeks. Might the infection be sharp, the pet can suffer of anorexy, weakness, anemia and fever; if it is chronic, lost of weight and anorexy might be present. If the infection is atypical,  the dog might present accumulation of liquid in the abdominal cavity - ascitis, edemas, neurological, heart and lungs problems. To diagnose,  the symptoms of the animal must be observed and specific laboratory tests must be made, such as serologies and identification of the organism.

The treatment will depend on the veterinarian\u00B4s criteria, and it is sometimes difficult, yet impossible, long and expensive. The fight against the mosquito is the only way of prevention and for that, necklaces that repel them must be used, nets for the houses, to avoid at dusk walks for rivers or humid places (moment of more activity for mosquitos), to fumigate, to use candles that drive away them of terraces and, inside the constructions, using plugs antimosquitos.

The smaller the size of the race, the more premature it will be the zeal. Nevertheless it is not a thing of concern that a dog has not even received the first one after the first year, because there are many circumstances that determine that fact. It is only strange that a dog has not received the zeal after year and half of life, case in which we should take it to the veterinarian. <br><b> The frequency </b> \: Although some races receive the zeal once per year, as the Basenji, in most this has a frequency of twice per year, that is to say, every six months. While our dog\u00B4s zeal is to regulate, you should not worry that there is bigger time from zeal to another. But be alert in case an irregularity is presented, it is important to control and to write down how often she has the cycle. On the other hand, if the zeal is very frequent it becomes necessary to take it to the veterinarian to discard possible problems in the reproductive system, as the ovarian cysts. <br>  It is not strange that the dog\u00B4s never suffer the menopause, and that therefore they continue having the zeal until their death. <br><b> The duration </b> \: Zeal usually lasts between 15 and 20 days, even 25. In this period of time the dog\u00B4s behavior and temper are altered, their external genital can grow and to swell, a vaginal hemorrhage is presented and its affluence varies with each dog. The bleeding and the menstrual cycle in the women doesn\u00B4t have any relationship with the bleeding in female dog\u00B4s, this is simply a bigger contribution of blood to the genital apparatus - for the action of the hormones. It is used as an announcement to the male. The stages of the zeal are four, Proestro, Estro, Diestro and Anoestro. Only during the Estro the reproductive system is prepared and there is ovulation. If you are looking for your female dog to be ready for the gestation, it is recommended to do a cytological follow up using the study of smear of the vagina, so that the exact moment of the ovulation is determined. The ovulation is usually presented one day after the bleed stops, so that if you don\u00B4t want your dog gets pregnant, you should pay attention to the moment when the bleed disappears. <br>  When the estro concludes it is possible that the dog suffers such hormonal imbalances as the "pseudo-gestation", in which the organism conserves erroneous hormonal levels and its metabolism acts as if pregnancy existed. It changes according to the dog, but behaviors like cries can be presented, scratched of floor, alteration of the appetite, preparation of the nest, even the adoption of a puppet. They can even produce milk. Maybe not all the symptoms are presented, but it can happen that the case requires attention, either for the behavior or for the quantity of milk that is segregated, that will make imperative to go to the veterinarian in treatment search. </p>

It is not convenient to use this long term method because it carries secondary effects in the genital conduit, such as ovarian cysts and infections.   The extreme and definitive measure to impede the hormonal activity and the pregnancy is the surgical treatment that only puts an end to both or one only. The bond of trumpet\u00B4s or hysterectomy puts an end to the pregnancy possibilities, the zeal remains.  If we are only interested in diminish the risk of pregnancy, it could be enough, but the dog would continue having zeal (bleeding) In the ovary-hysterectomy, to be removed the ovaries, the zeal is eliminated. </p><u> NOTICE </u> \: <br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> All surgery can bear problems, besides being traumatic and unnatural. But this turns out to be an easy solution for who doesn\u00B4t want that their animal reproduces, also contributing the animal bigger longevity, because he puts an end to the risk to illnesses in the reproductive system. Even so it is a castration. After the procedure the animal deserves special attention, the exercise and the feeding should be watched over. The market offers a great variety of dog food, even special food for not reproductive animals. </p> 
7618= <b><a name\="0041"> GESTATION AND BIRTH </b></a><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> Many factors influence in the time of gestation, for what this can be determined with little accuracy. The date of the mating, the duration of the estro or zeal and the ovulation date influence the time of gestation. After the mating, it lasts approximately 9 weeks. Nevertheless, the smaller the race is, the less time the time of gestation will be. The number of puppies in the litter will also alter the duration of the gestation. This way, when the number of puppies is high, this could last between 55 and 57 days. <BR><BR> The most effective method to determine the pregnancy in the dog is the ultrasound, because the animal, contrary to the woman, doesn\u00B4t suffer significant hormonal changes that might determine the time of gestation by blood or urine exams. Although these days there are some exams made with a hormone called relaxina, this is effective only until half of the gestation. </p>   
7619= <b><a name\="0042"><u> Feeding </b></a></u><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> A pregnant dog, during the first four weeks should eat like it was used to, taking care that its weight doesn\u00B4t increase, because the overweight can bring problems during the birth. Then, from the fifth week until the nursing time, the food should provide more proteins, minerals - calcium - and energy, because the bony system of the puppies is being formed. With such an end there is food and supplements in the market, or food for all the ages can be given in the same quantity.  But, although the dog\u00B4s feeding continues being the same one during this period, it is important to move away of its diet foods that could be difficult to digest, like the viscera and the remains of food. In the seventh week the daily portion of food should be increased in a fourth part. It is also recommended that the number of food portions in the day is bigger, because the dog won\u00B4t eat a lot for the pressure of the puppies in her paunch. <BR><BR>  During the nursing, the quantity of food given to the dog should be even bigger. After one month of the birth, the quantity of food the mother used to eat before the pregnancy should be duplicate or triplicate, because the size of the dog\u00B4s will be bigger. Two or three weeks after you have begun giving solid food to the puppies, when they get used to this, the nursing should be interrupted. That day, do not give food to the dog, only water. The next day, give the dog a fourth part from what was given before the pregnancy, the next day give it half, the third day fourth three parts, and the fourth day give it the normal quantity of food it used to take. However, if the mother looks weak and very thin, you will have to increase the portion a little until the dog recovers completely. </p> 
7620= <b><a name\="0043"><u> Veterinarian Controls </b></a></u><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> The pregnancy won\u00B4t change a lot the behavior of the female during the first third, although many can eat more or capriciously. If you observe in your dog strange signs, go to the veterinarian, even if you suspect of a possible pregnancy; this way the veterinarian will practice an ultrasound to discard an illness. When 21 days of gestation have passed, this method will be effective and a good image of the animals in the belly will be obtained lapsed between 25 and 28 days. <br>  Although a x-ray has smaller cost and it allows to know the number of dog\u00B4s in the litter, the ultrasound is recommended because it let the veterinarian verify of each one of the puppies, it also helps to foresee birth difficulties; it is not a threat to the health neither of the mother neither of those gestated, and additionally shows any strange bundle that is not a normal fetus. However it should be done by a specialized person. <br><br>  A dog under good physical conditions will be the ideal animal to gestate. On the other hand, when they exist in the animal hereditary problems or anomalies like the hip displasya that can make the birth difficult, it is better not to let them get pregnant. The illnesses in the liver and in the kidneys or deficiencies in the immunologic system can be also a problem. Neither it is convenient that the dog has internal or external infections or parasites. Although a dog that suffers of anyone of these affections can engender, if this happens, difficulties can be presented as much for her as for her puppies, which can inherit her conditions. <br><br>  It is also recommended that the dog is young, but, once again, the age won\u00B4t impede the gestation. It is also better if the dog has more than one year, and you/he/she has happened at least her first zeal. It is made because the Caesarean operation is traumatic for the body, and a young dog will heal more easily in case there is a complication that forces to extract the puppies by means of surgery. <br><br>  While the stomach doesn\u00B4t grow (the paunch grows starting from the sixth or seventh week), the female should continue exercising like before except for the activities that require too much effort or that are too difficult. Once put on weight, the dog will diminish its movements, because it will uncomfortable with the weight of the puppies in the belly. </p>

The dog will usually be able to manage itself the birth. A nest in a box with some blankets and washable towels (built days before so that the future mother familiarizes) could be the place in which the birth happens, although it is also possible that the dog takes refuge under a bed. The sides of the box should have the enough height so that it makes of corral for the puppies. Towels or cotton cloths will keep the puppies warm, or we can use an infrareds source to regulate the temperature of the room. During the day previous to the birth the temperature of the dog\u00B4s rectum descends a grade, up to 37,5. The dog is disturbed and usually stops eating, and by those hours the contractions can begin and they happen while the uterine neck expands, lasting between 6 and 12 hours, and even 24 hours. <br>  Then the dog search the solitude, waiting that he/she expands the uterine neck completely, after that she expels the puppies and then the placenta. The puppies can take a long time in leaving one after the other one from ten minutes and even hours.  A pause doesn\u00B4t necessarily mean that it has finished, it can be a break to renew the activity later. Although the dog can make it independently, it is better if you are attentive. A small bleeding is normal, strong hemorrhages are not normal.

If she didn\u00B4t do it, you should break the bag, to clean the puppy\u00B4s muzzle, to knead it vigorously to stimulate its breathing and to heat it or to take it to the mother so she will take care of it. The same way, if she doesn\u00B4t cut the cord, you will have to do it. </P><u> How to cut the cord </u><ol><li> Make a knot with thread 30 millimeters away of the gut of the dog, and other more far. </li><li> Cut between the two knots with clean scissors. </li><li> Apply some iodine with gauze for some seconds. </li></ol><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> If you should want to cut the tail of the puppies, it is necessary to take them puppies to the veterinarian 3 or 4 days after born. After four or six weeks after the birth the mother\u00B4s uterus returns to the normality. It is possible that while this happens, and even eight weeks after the birth, the dog has a dark brown vaginal secretion, like blood. However, while the dog doesn\u00B4t seem to be sick, this is totally normal. </p><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> Causes of Abortion\: Since it is so difficult to determine the gestation, and that in many cases abortions are presented before we can make it, it is difficult to know which are the most common causes for this to happen. </p>

It is also important that it has received all the necessary vaccines before taking it out to the street. If this is not possible, avoid the places where there are many dogs, where there are feces or urines of dog\u00B4s, and start teaching it should make its necessities outside the house, at least once per day. <br><br> As soon as the puppy gets home, allow it to explore the place, let it walk to familiarize with the place and with those who it will live with. It is normal that the dog is nervous or restless, because it has been separated from his mother and he faces unknown people. It is important to make that this transition is the less traumatic thing possible. It will look for isolated places, as corners, to rest. Then it will be necessary to show him its bed, the place of its food and where it can urinate. </p>

It is good to take it out after the foods and when it wakes up in the mornings. For the speed of their metabolism, it can make its necessities inside house at the beginning, and it is important to nag it so it will know that it is not allowed to do it. When it makes it in the street, you should reward it with a cookie that then you can replace with caresses and encouraging words, so that it knows that that made it is well. </P>

If it will be punished, it should be made exactly after the bad action and of the reproach, if not, it won\u00B4t understand. An emphatic "NO" is more useful that a blow granted by the same hand that consents it, because with this you just confuse it. To reward it, simply caressed it or tell it an encouraging word. <br><br>  From the beginning it should learn how to use necklace and belt. The first days, since it is something strange for the dog, it can be difficult, so you should play to distract it to put on it. With the time it won\u00B4t be a complicated task anymore, because the dog already knows that if it is put the belt it is because it will leave, and this makes it happy. It will also be necessary to teach him to obey the call, first in the house, from another room and then in the street. Every time that it goes you should reward it, no matter if it takes a long time, in which case you should not nag him, because it could associate coming with a punishment. Only when it has already learned how to obey to the call you can loose it in the street, do it before would be imprudent. <br><br>  It is not necessary that you change your schedules to be with the dog. Simply with using your spare times, a one hour per day training in which the principles of its education are reviewed would be enough.

For that reason it should be reprehended from the beginning, although it saddens you, or the dog will believe it has more power than it has and then it won\u00B4t obey. It should know clearly who gives order, and who it must respect. For that reason you should not feed with the hand, neither to allow him to stay in places of difficult access inside of the house from those that it can control the space. It is also important to teach him that every time that something bothers it, when it is bored or when it wants food, it should not bark.

In the game you can use elements like bones of lamb skin, biting toys of plastic, balls, and even sticks.

These are: </p><ol><li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Fear: The dog behaves aggressive before a situation that generates fear or anguishes, because this way it liberates its sensations. Since the aggression doesn�t usually have previous warning in these cases, it can end up being dangerous, because the fear doesn�t allow it to control the force in its bite. The owner should not be intimidated, because this will only worsen the situation. A specialist should be consulted </P></li><li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Dominancy: A dominant dog or a dog who tries to be dominant, behaves aggressively to win territory. It can impede the movement of people and their retreat staying in places where it can control and by means of grunts. It will also be aggressive if its toys are touched or while it is being brushed. </P></li><li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This dog mounts dog�s of its same gender and people it lives with as dominance sign. If it bites its master, it will go to lick it in the place, but not as a submissive act of pardon but as the boss of the flock who worries for the members of it. </P></li><li><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Predatory:   The aggressiveness can also be caused by the hunger, although this behavior can end up being rather physiologic, because it is also presented in satiate dog�s.

Although the owner wants to take it always with it, depending on the place to he will go, and on the transportation, in occasions it results to be simply impossible. However, this should not be an impediment to take a dog to house, because there are many ways to deal with the situation. <br><br><u> Short trips </u> Although the owner will make an only some days trip, the dog�s are very dependent and they should not be left alone at home. They need somebody to take them out, to go for a walk, and in most of the cases somebody who administers their food, because they are gluttons, and if they are left their everyday food, they could eat it all the first day. <br>  There are dog�s that are not so dependent, like the guardian dog�s that can stay alone for days, but in general a homemade dog won�t know how to be handle the situation by itself. <br><br><u> Taking the dog with you </u><br><br> Before deciding to take the dog to the vacations, it is worthwhile to find out the conditions of the place you are going, because they might not receive animals, and although they do it, it might not be the appropriate place for a dog.

For that reason it is important to take out the dog for more than some few minutes. It is not enough to take it out for a short walk and then keep it inside the car with a half open window while you and your family refresh. The dog truly needs to be ventilated. If the air it breathes is very hot, the dog won\u00B4t be refreshed, because he refreshes by breathing and heave, and this will cause a flaw in his system. <br>  * In the First Aids section you will find information about what you should do in this situation. </P>

Since the dog�s can feel nervous for these situations, it is recommended to give them a sedative one slight that tranquilizes them and not to give them food for some hours before the trip. <br><br>  Also, the documents of the dog should be taken, as their identification and their vaccine card.

Nevertheless, inside the owner\u00B4s obligations there is the one of cleaning the feces, because these transmit parasitic illnesses and infections. This is very important, because the animals are not only in infection risk, the humans also.

7643= <b><a name\="0065">HOW  THE DOG\u00B4S COMMUNICATE? </b></a><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> One of the most interesting and important aspects in the life of the dog\u00B4s is the way in which they communicate to each other and it is the same they use to communicate with human. <br><br> In an interview that I maintained with a person who consulted me for an undesirable behavior that his dog was presenting, I checked that not only some people ignore that the dog\u00B4s communicate to each other and with people but also that many professionals who are devoted to the study of the human behavior even deny it. During this interview I explained to the owner of the dog that part of the problem that she had with her pet was due to that she was not able to understand the messages the animal sent and that, therefore, she reacted improperly before certain situations. This did not only solve their problem but rather increased it. The surprise and confusion expression in her face motivated that I interrupted my explanation to ask her if she had understood what I had told her. It was in that moment when the woman, who was a psychology student, told me a fact that not only caused me surprise but also certain dislike. She told me that in an opportunity she had maintained a conversation with her professor about the behavior of her dog and that he had denied flatly that the existence of any communication among the animal and less even between these and people. Although I never knew the arguments of such an opinion, I proceeded to explain to my speaker why the sentence was completely mistaken. <br>   One of the most important premises for the subsistence of the social species, like the dog\u00B4s, it is to have the possibility to transmit information from an individual to another with the objective of maintaining the interaction of the group in appropriate form. This is not another thing that a communication system that in the case of the dog\u00B4s doesn\u00B4t only exist but it is very complex and it is based fundamentally on auditory, visual, smell and tactile signs. By means of these signs the animals do not only maintain the order inside the group, but rather they also identify and they mark their territory, they know the physiologic and emotional state of their equals as well as their social range.  Said in other words, although the dog\u00B4s do not speak, they communicate to each other through expressions, postures, sounds and scents. This way, they express their emotional state, desires, necessities and status. Also, this communication system is not only used by the canines in their relationship with their equals but also with human, although some of these ignore it or they it. For this reason, it is indispensable that all the owner\u00B4s or future owner\u00B4s of dog\u00B4s know the form in that these animals communicate, this way they will learn how to understand them. Also, this will facilitate a better coexistence between two species, the human and the canine that, with no doubt can establish a fluent communication with each other. <br><br></P><u> Auditory signs\: </u><br><br><u>  Vocalizations </u><p align\="justify"> The same as their wild predecessor, the wolf, the dog presents five types different of vocalizations\: bark, grunt, groan, yelp and howl. The difference between dog\u00B4s and wolves resides in the proportion in that both use these sounds. The bark is much more used by the domestic canines, while the howl is more frequently emitted by its wild relatives. This difference is due basically to that the selection made by human during the domestication process favored certain behavior characteristics that were useful for the human group. An alarm sign as the bark was important when communicating the presence of potential aggressors. </p><ul><li><u> Bark </u><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> The bark is genetically a behavior rule programmed that completes specific functions in the expression of the canines. However, the dog\u00B4s can use the bark in very diverse situations and for different ends when they obtain a reward. That is to say that although the bark is an innate behavior that doesn\u00B4t require learning, its use by the dog\u00B4s could be influenced by this a learning process. <br> A typical example is the dog\u00B4s that bark to request food that its owner is eating who, with the purpose of keep the dog quite, satisfies the demand of the animal. Another example is those dog\u00B4s that bark either getting the owner\u00B4s attention to play or to leave for a walk, because they know that with that attitude they will convince the owner that he / she makes what they want. We see this way how the bark can acquire different functions through the learning, according to the results obtained by the animal when emitting this vocalization. <br>  The specific functions of the bark, it means, those common to almost all the dog\u00B4s and the wolves are basically four. One of them is calling all the members of the group to begin an action. In the wolves this action is related in general with the hunts, while in the dog\u00B4s, with the games or walks. <br>  The bark also completes an alarm function, which was specially selected by the man during the domestication. In this case, the bark is good to warn to the rest of the group that something strange happens, as for example that an intruder is trying to enter in the house of the family which the dog cohabits with. <br>  Another of the functions of the bark is to threat. Using the previous example, the bark would be guided in this case toward the intruder, not toward the group of owner\u00B4ship of the dog. The objective is to scare the stranger and to persuade it of moving away from the place. <br>  Therefore, it is probable that the dog uses the bark like an alarm sign or like a threat before the presence of strange. Because in the alarm and the threat, aggressiveness and fear are present, it is important to listen to the tone of the bark to know the emotional state of the dog. If the bark has a high tone, it is very probable that the fear of the animal is bigger than its level of aggressiveness; on the contrary, if the aggressiveness prevails, the vocalization will be of low tone. It is interesting to know, mainly for those lovers of the comparisons that the psychologists have identified the same characteristics in people. When somebody is angry and aggressive it emits a serious voice (low tone), while if he / she is afraid the voice will be sharp and screamer (high tone). <br>  The frequency with which a dog emits the bark can also reflect his emotional state. If it is high, that is to say, if the vocalization repeats quickly, the dog is very excited; on the contrary, if the sounds are not very frequent or spaced, they indicate a smaller excitement grade. In the first case, trying to modify the attitude of the dog will be a difficult task, while in the second case it will be easier to change their state of spirit. This would be indicating that the bark can also be good to relieve their tensions. A clear example is those dog\u00B4s that bark for anxiety when the owner\u00B4s leave them alone. If the anxiety is very intense, the dog\u00B4s will emit their barks with great frequency and intensity, while if the anxiety is low the frequency and intensity of this vocalization will be smaller. /P></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Grunt </u><br> The grunt is a vocalization of low tone whose primordial function is the communication of the aggressive state of the dog. The same as other vocalizations, the grunt is generally accompanied by certain corporal postures. It means that with combinations of both the originator manifests a complex emotional state. <br>  A dog whose level of aggressiveness is very superior to the fear will grunt and, at the same time, it will retract the lips to show its teeth during the encounter with a canine or human rival before attacking. In this case the posture will be the one that indicates the imminence of the attack. However, in this situation a minimum level of fear exists, if it doesn\u00B4t, the attack would be silent. In the other hand, if the dog only grunts, although the aggression level continues being high, something exists more than fear. This indicates that the attack could not be so imminent although the probability that it takes place will be very high still. If the fear continues increasing in detriment of the aggressiveness, the grunts will surely begin to be alternated with barks and the risk of an attack will be smaller than in the other cases. If the grunt disappears and the dog only barks, it means that the dog is in a situation of interior conflict\: it is not encouraged to attack but neither feels so much fear to escape. This explanation is the one that gives sustenance and certain validity to the famous one said popular dog that barks doesn\u00B4t bite. Nevertheless, if in some moment the aggression overcomes the fear the dog will be able to attack, fact that demonstrates that dog\u00B4s do not care much about human proverbs. <br>  Finally, a situation exists in which combine the grunt and the attitude of showing the teeth, in the one that the levels of aggressiveness and fear are both very high. If a dog is penned by another dog or a person and without possibility of escaping, it will deploy these behavioral rules until the aggressor puts a certain distance, denominated critic distance, moment in which the dog will attack immediately in spite of the fear. The concept of critic distance is defined as the distance in which an animal threatened for other and without possibilities of escaping, deploys an aggressive behavior its only defense alternative. Everybody at any time may have listened to the statement it attacked as penned rat that illustrates the recently mentioned principle. And if we talk about comparisons, this can be valid in the case of the rats like in the case of the dog\u00B4s and why not, also in the human beings. </P></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Groan </u><br>  The groan is a plaintive sound and of high but soft tone. It has different functions according to the age and the emotional state of the originator. The puppies that are still with the mother use it as call to request their cares; the mother usually responds providing attention to the small ones offering them heat, affection or food. When the puppies become part of a human family they usually groan when they leave them alone, act that not only constitutes a call for obtaining company but also a form of manifesting the anxiety and the anguish that this situation causes to them. The same happens in the mature animals when they experience frustrating situations, as when the owner of a dog locks it in the garden while he stays inside the house. The dog possibly begins to groan to liberate the anxiety that generates the confinement. Also, if by means of this innate reaction the animal is able to get the owner\u00B4s attention and to enter again in the house, in the future it will emit this sound every time that it is put in the same situation. In this case the motivation of the behavior in question is different; because in the previous one the dog, through the learning, associated that the emission of wailings is related with its return to the interior of the house. <br>  The groan is also used as much for the puppies as for the dog\u00B4s in juvenile age and for the adults during the friendly reception that takes place before the arrival of some member of the family or some well-known person for them. <br>  Lastly, this vocalization is a resource that the dog\u00B4s use like a submission demonstration before the sudden presence of a dominant dog, with the objective of inhibiting the possible aggression. </P></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Yelp </U><br> The yelp is a sharp and unpleasant vocalization, generally emitted in situations of physical pain or before an intense emotional disturbance, like a sudden fright for example. The intensity of this sound and the frequency with which is emitted depend on the magnitude of the stimulus that produces it and of the individuals sensibility. The yelp is more frequent in the puppies and in the mature individuals of submissive type. <br>  Although it can be emitted in general in diverse circumstances that generate pain or fear, it happens in two situations that have supreme importance in the social behavior of the dog. The first of them is the one that is presented during the game of the puppies in the stage in which their social behavior is modeled. If a puppy bites strong to other, the one attacked emits a yelp and it interrupts the game; this makes that the aggressor learns how to regulate the intensity of their bite. The second situation happens when a mature dog attacks a puppy or another submissive mature dog. In this case the yelp is part of the submission behavior and it has for purpose to inhibit the dominant individuals aggression. </P></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Howl </u><br>  The howl is an auditory sign that consists on a continuous sound whose duration varies from one to eleven seconds and that it fluctuates in a range from 150 to 780 cycles per second. This vocalization is much more frequent in the wolves that in the dog\u00B4s, due to the different lifestyles of the wolves with regard to its domestic relatives. <br>   The howl has as main function to decide and to coordinate the movements of the flock, from the voyages to the hunts. The dog that is fed and taken out of walk for its owner doesn\u00B4t have necessity to organize the group and therefore habitually doesn\u00B4t have big motivations to emit this vocalization. <br>  Nevertheless, the dog\u00B4s usually howl in two well defined circumstances. One of them happens when a dog is left suddenly alone. The solitude stimulates the emission of the howl that has the same function that in the wolves\: to reinforce the cohesion of the group. In the wild life the result of the howl of solitude is to attract the other members of the flock; however, the dog\u00B4s of the city rarely get their proprietors to go in their search, but rather that the neighbors get angry. <br>  The second circumstance also frequent in the flocks of wolves it happens when the howl of an individual stimulates that other wolves emit the same vocalization with the rising formation of a choir. This is due to a denominated phenomenon "social facilitation"\: the behavior of an animal works as stimulus to unchain the same behavior in other animals. For that reason when a dog frequently howls it is accompanied in his manifestation by the rest of the dog\u00B4s of neighborhood. Plus, in the big cities it is habitual that the dog\u00B4s begin to howl when hearing the sound of the sirens of the ambulances, the firemen, etc.. This attitude might occur presumably because the dog\u00B4s assume this sound correspond to a message emitted by some other dog. </P </li></ul><u> Visual signals </u><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"> One of the most common ways of communication among the dog\u00B4s in a flock is related to the visual signs. Starting from them, the animals can recognize the social range of each member of the group and their state of humor. They can also be used by the human to understand the emotional state of a dog and to achieve a better relationship with the animal. <br><br> Every owner of a dog knows that if the animal arches the body with its frontal members descended and the back ones elevated, at the same time that it makes quick movements with the tail, it shows an invitation attitude to the game. Then it will surely try to pursue the game partner or to be pursued by him. But this is only a visual sign. To know the movements and expressions of a dog allows us to better understand its attitudes. <br><br>  Although these signs are manifested as a combination, we can analyze them in three different sectors for the best understanding. </p><ol type \="1"><li><p align\="justify"><u> The head </u> This sector is the most important in what concerns to the visual expression. Showing the teeth with the open mouth taking the labial corners forward, with muzzle and wrinkled front, straight ears and also bowed forward, the high head and the fixed look, indicates a threat behavior, aggressive, expressed by a self-confident animal. These expressions and postures are frequently observed in dominant dog\u00B4s.  On the contrary, an insecure dog that expresses submission or intention of escaping, expresses itself maintaining the mouth closed, with the labial corners to the back, eyes not very open and ears also back in contact with the head that habitually stays low. When a dog presents aggressiveness and fear at the same time - fact that many times happen when the animal is penned - an overlapping of the motor rules of escaping and attack appears, giving place to intermediate expressions that demonstrate the conflict situation. In opposition, the straight ears, the head subtly inclined, the relaxed and slightly half-open mouth indicates a state of attention completely out of fear or aggression. <br>  In what concerns to the visual signs regarding the head, it is important to keep in mind that during the domestication process and creation of the different canine breeds, morphological changes were caused, such as hanging ears and hair that cover the whole face of the dog and its eyes too. These facts many times can not make difficult the communication among the animals and it can simply carry serious problems among the dog\u00B4s because of the lack of understanding of the visual signs </p></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> The tail </u><br><br> The tail is also a good indicator of its emotional state. Regarding the tail, there are two indications to keep in mind. One is the position and the other one its movement. As for the first one, if the tail is suspended, hanging from the base, it is indicating a calmed attitude, with no tension. <br><br>  There are two extreme tail positions. In one of them, the dog elevates the tail over his back and locates it in perpendicular form to this; in this case it expresses an emotional state of security in itself. The opposed position that consists on maintaining the tail low even putting it between the back members, demonstrates that the animal feels great insecurity and fear. This position is adopted by the submissive individuals in the flock, that is to say, of a low social range. The medium range members in the flock have the tail located among the two mentioned positions. <br>  In what concerns to the movement of the tail, this is related with an excitement situation. Weigh movements, habitually short and quick, they generally indicate mainly a friendly and submissive attitude if the tail is not lifted. On the other hand, if it is located in vertical position and the movements are abrupt they indicate that they are deployed by an animal of great hierarchy whose probable emotions are the sexual excitement, ludical or even the aggression. For this reason it is of vital importance to observe other attitudes of the dog and the context in which the situation is developed to establish a correct interpretation of its emotions. <br>  In this point it is important to clarify that when cutting the tail to a puppy, this animal is in clear disadvantage with regard to other dog\u00B4s, since the absence of this way of information can interfere in the communication of the animals. At the same time, this fact can also difficult the interpretation of the emotions of these dog\u00B4s by human. </p></li><li><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> The paws and the body </u>  In this sector we can also find signs that express different mood, emotions or messages. A friendly dog that wants to inform to others it wants to play, will bend over with the forequarters extended, the hindquarters lifted and the head almost leaning on the floor. On the contrary, a not very friendly dog, although not momentarily aggressive, will come closer slowly to another dog, very straight and with the extremities tense, which constitutes a dominance message. If the receiver of the message is a submissive animal that seeks to leave clear its not aggressive intention, it will lay and will could or not show the paunch.  
7644=But if it doesn\u00B4t agree on undergoing, it will adopt a dominant posture and it will possibly bristle to hair of the neck and cross. This is a posture of active defense; which means aggressive; that indicates big probabilities of an imminent attack. <br>  The position that dog\u00B4s adopt when they urinate constitutes another visual sign of supreme importance. The males frequently lift a back paw when they urinate, this behavior is due to the male hormone testosterone. In general, the more dominant it is the dog, the more it will elevate the paw when it urinates. This is not only a clear indication of their social range, but also of the security in itself and of possession of the territory. Another form of visual communication is the one denominated clawed or rasped of the floor. The dog "rasps" the floor with one or more paws, generally after defecating, leaving a visible mark. This mark is accompanied by a chemical sign coming from the sweating glands located at level of the pads and of the inter digital sebaceous glands. These signs which are more frequently emitted by the males than for the females have two meanings. The first one is that when being used by the individuals of bigger hierarchy of the group and being stimulated by the presence of other dog\u00B4s, they constitute a demonstration of the social range of the originator.  And the second one is that because the mark left in the floor lasts for some time, the dog informs that the territory in question has owner. </p></li></ol><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Smelling signs </u><br><br><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY">  The communication through the sense of smell by chemical messages is very difficult to study because the perception of the scents in the environment is totally different between the dog\u00B4s and the humans. The development of this sense is much poorer in us and because of that it is of much less frequent use. However, for dog\u00B4s, the smelling signs constitute a very important factor during their interaction with the environment. <BR>  This type of signs is produced by odoriferous secretions, called pheromones, contained in the urine, the anal glands, the sebaceous glands, the sweating glands of the pads and the ears. Because these secretions are used as a communication media among different individuals they are denominated "social pheromones" and the scents they emit are "social scents". These scents can be divided in two groups\: <BR><BR><B> Identifying Scents </B>  they are those specific and characteristic of each individual and through which the animals identify each other. For that reason when two dog\u00B4s meet, they smell so much to each other all the anal area, the genital one and the ears. Also, thanks to these scents, each animal can recognize his group of ownership as well as its own territory. <BR><b> Emotional scents\: </b>  they are produced and liberated in very special circumstances, such as the stress, the fear or the zeal in the female dog\u00B4s. For example, in situations of intense fear a dog can compress his anal sacks vigorously, to eliminate his content and to produce a very characteristic penetrating scent. On the other hand, the urine of the dog\u00B4s in zeal contains chemical substances that act like signs announcing its physiologic state and in the same way its possible receptive mood to a male. </p><P ALIGN\="JUSTIFY"><u> Tactile Signs </u><br><br>  The tactile communication is one of the most important in the dog\u00B4s, fundamentally to either express its social range inside the flock or in its coexistence with the human family. The tact, contrary to the other communication types, requires the physical contact between two individuals; for this reason, in general it is later to the visual and smelling signs. <br>  Basically we can distinguish two types of tactile signs. Those dedicated to demonstrate a high social hierarchy, used by the dominant individuals and those dedicated to demonstrate a social range under, used hierarchically by the inferior individuals. Among the first ones, calls dominance signs, the most common are\: <ul><li><p align\="justify"> The support of the muzzle of a dog on the shoulders of the other one as form of demonstrating their superiority. If this is accepted the receptor of the message will make submission expressions to manifest their respect for the dominant dog. If the dominance sign is not accepted the risk of a fight is imminent. </p></li><li><p align\="justify">  The pressure of a dog on the neck of another when surrounding it with the open mouth. This sign is based on the behavior that the mothers use to transfer and to dominate their puppies. </p></li><li><p align\="justify"> The support of the hindquarters on another individual, either another dog or a person. This is one of the tactile signs more observed in the interaction of a dog with their proprietor. The reception that makes a dog jumping and supporting their front paws on their owner\u00B4s body is interpreted as a greeting. Although this interpretation is not incorrect, it is important to know that this greeting is made with an attitude of domain of the situation. In other words, jumping on a human is the form of greeting that the dominant dog\u00B4s have. This attitude is also adopted during the game with human or with other dogs and it always takes implicit the same message from the dog\: "We are playing, but I order and I set the rules." </p></li><li><p align\="justify">  Surrounding the muzzle of a subordinate with their open mouth. This sign is used in the flock by the leader dog and its function is to control its follower\u00B4s behavior. </p></li><li><p align\="justify"> The demonstration of the hierarchical position starting from mounting another dog, beyond the typical attitude of mating </p></li><ul><p align\="justify"> For example, if a person meets with a strange dog, male and mature, and as a friendly attitude she or he tries to caress the head or the neck of the dog, there are big possibilities that this behavior is interpreted by the dog like a dominant sign and, therefore, take place an aggressive reaction on the part of the animal. Also, the action of many dog\u00B4s of taking with the mouth their owner\u00B4s arm or the belt during the walks - that many people interpret as if the animal is playing or it wants to take the owner to some place- it is not another thing that a tactile sign of dominance that indicates that the leader of that group is the dog and not the owner. Among the tactile signs dedicated to demonstrate low social level, called submission signs, the most common are\: </p><b><p align\="justify"> Muzzling, </b> which consists on giving small flicks with the muzzle or either lick the muzzle of another dog or the face and the hands of a person. This behavior is a reflection of that used by the puppies to request food to the mature dog\u00B4s and it is observed with a lot of frequency in the wolves. It is important to keep in mind that in many cases this behavior is modeled with the learning and it is used by many dog\u00B4s to capture the attention of its owner\u00B4s. <BR>  He nods that the animal makes when it looks for placing its head under their owner\u00B4s hand. This sign is usually used by the dogs to request caresses from a submission position. <BR>  For people that interact with their own or other peoples dog\u00B4s the knowledge of these signs is of vital importance, because this is the only way to possible understand the attitudes of the dog\u00B4s and to avoid aggression situations like consequence of human behaviors that are not understood by the animals, or vice versa. </p></ul></ul>

So that our pet can be a happy dog, it needs that <b> we dedicate part of our spare time </b> . </b><br>  Playing, running, jumping, etc., are typical actions of a dog and we should enjoy them with our dog, to get a balanced and happy dog. But not everything is playing and having fun, we need to inculcate our canine friend certain discipline, certain control. There are diverse training systems to get that control. <br><br> To train is to <b> teach and to convince </b> , not to force and to push. With the education system that we describe in the different phases of the training section, we get that our dog makes the different exercises and tricks with a minimum of pressure and a maximum of convincing. <br><br>  And remember an anonymous Arab proverb <b> "Caress your dog although you don\u00B4t know the reason, the dog knows it" </b></p>

You can also use the necklace belt; everything will depend on the physical and psychic skills of your dog. <br><br>  The sliding necklace can be of big links for dogs of long hair or of small links for dogs of short hair (how many more links more the hair of the animals is damaged due to the increase of areas of friction). <br><br>  The use of those necklaces is recommended for dogs of energetic character and of medium big size (never uses the prickles necklace to subject your dog. There are technical elements in the market to control uncontrolled dogs like the head necklace. 2 Always ask for expert\u00B4s help to solve your more serious problems). The necklace belt is advisable for dogs of soft character or races of small size. <br><br>  Once defined the control elements, it is necessary to have <b> rewards or toys to congratulate </b>  our four paws partner. There is infinity of them, but I advise that they use a "well differentiated toy" of any element that it can find at home atmosphere.

If the animal insists, we will order <i> "NO" "TER" </i>  and <i> "STILL" </i>  with more energy in the same area and of course we will never give the dog anything at the table during the food. <br><br>  Sofas\: The animals that sleep in the sofas of the houses have usually been consented from very small to be gone up without any control. To correct them, we must create in the animal the necessity to get off the sofa because the floor is more amusing or there are nutritious recompenses. All this, combined with the order <i> "NO" </i>  accompanied by <i> "TER" </i>  in their place of sleeping, it will make disappear this bad habit </p> . </P><u> REMEMBER </u><ul><li> The tricks are necessary for the <i> DOG-OWNER </i> communication </li><li> Use the tricks positively </li><li> Don\u00B4t consent that your dog wins in an incorrect action  Correct your dog firmly but without violence and with a later reward. </li></ul> 
7663= <b><a name="0082"> FIRST AIDS </b></a><br><br><p align="justify"> Before an unexpected accident suffered by the dog, the most important thing is to maintain the calm all the time. It is important to have the veterinarian�s or emergency clinic phone numbers, in case we need to call for instructions on what to do if before taking the dog for medical attention. The Toxicology Service phone number will also be necessary if the dog would eat or drink some toxic substance. </P><u><b> First-aid kit elements: </u></b><br><ul><li> Medications previously prescribed by the veterinarian (that will be given to the animal if the veterinarian indicates it by telephone) <li></li> Oxygenated water (3%) to disinfect scratching, and wounded superficial <li></li> Cotton, gauze, medical adhesive tape, sterile syringes <li></li> Rectal thermometer (you should learn how to use it correctly previously) <li></li>  Pincers (to extract objects or animals incrusted in the skin of the dog) </li></ul><br><br><p align="justify"><u><b> What to do if the dog is wounded:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you take any action, it is important to put to the dog a muzzle, because, while in pain, it can become aggressive and attack who helps him. However, if the dog is vomiting, the muzzle should not be put because it would drown. <BR>  In the event of not having muzzle, it serves a scarf, a bandage or a cloth equally with which the muzzle of the animal will be surrounded, and a low knot the chin will be made. Then pass it from behind of the ears and make a second knot again to assure. When the dog is big, to get it up, somebody should bend over and pass the arm surrounding the back paws from the outside of behind. <BR>  In case you will take the dog in the car, it is better if a second person accompanies the driver to hold the dog while the other one drives. <br><br><u><b>How to make a bandage:</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moisture gauze with cold water, and put it on the wound. Pass a bandage over the gauze and held with medical tape, it will hold on until arriving at a clinic or to the veterinarian. Never use cotton, because threads can remain on the wound. <BR><BR>  This bandage is not a definitive treatment. The dog must be taken to the veterinarian so its condition is evaluated and it will be given the appropriate treatment. <br><br><u><b>Breathing problems:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this situation, the dog should be taken immediately to the veterinarian. The blue tongue, constant heave or the emission of noise when breathing, are possible signs of a breathing problem. <br><br><u><b> Fractures:</b></u> Avoid that the dog moves and notice if there is hemorrhage. To transport the dog, wrap up the fracture with cotton and immobilized the extremity with wound newspaper and carefully make a bandage <br><br><u><b> Burns:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog suffers a burn of first grade if the skin is red and the coat is scorched. If this is the case, apply a cream for burns on the affected area. If the burn is due to some chemical product, you should wash the area with abundant water for about 15 minutes before taking the dog to the veterinarian. <br><br><u><b>React allergic:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog that suffers an allergic reaction can present anyone of the following symptoms: sneezes, swollen face, tears, difficulty to breathe, collapse and even loss of the knowledge. Before a serious allergy it should be taken to the veterinarian immediately. <br><br><u><b>Hemorrhages:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bandage should be applied if the dog bleeds a lot, if don�t, the animal can lose the knowledge. If the bandage doesn�t stop the hemorrhage, take the dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible. <br><br><u><b>Asphyxia:</B></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;An element blocked in the throat of the dog will make it suffer asphyxia. If this happens, keep its mouth open and incline its head up. With the hands, carefully, try to remove the object. If this doesn�t work, place yourself kneeling behind the animal, surrounding their ribs from under with your arms. Narrow vigorously several times, although not with abruptness. If this neither works, take it to the veterinarian as soon as possible. <br><br> <u><b>Breathlessness:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dog is drowning and you don�t know how to reanimate the animal, it is better to take it immediately to the veterinarian. Nevertheless, in the meanwhile, put its face up for ten or fifteen seconds. This perhaps provides him something of relief.<br><br> <u><b>Electrocution:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dog enters in contact with some element that transmits electrical power, the first thing that should be made is to cut the power and to separate it without touching directly, like with a stick or some object that doesn�t transmit electricity. Then go to the veterinarian. The dog might have suffered burns, breathing inadequacy and even more. <br><br><u><b>Freezing:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is very cold some parts of the dog, as the pads, the ears, the tail or the feet can suffer freezing. The skin becomes red, brilliant and pale. Then it should be taken to a warm place and with a wet cloth with warm water cover the frozen parts, repeating this operation a while later and as many times as necessary until you notice improvement in the skin. Then take it to the veterinarian, so that he verifies that there are not damages like consequence of the freezing.<br><br><b><u>Blow of heat:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dog is in a very hot place and with little ventilation, his corporal temperature can increase in excess, since it doesn�t eliminate the heat by means of the perspiration. <br>  If he has high fever, it pants a lot and it suffers a collapse, it should be submerged up to the neck in cold water and to drip it with a hose for 10 minutes. Put ice on its head, it will also to overcome the attack, and when its temperature lowers, it should be taken to the veterinarian. <br><br> <u><b>Eye�s injures:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dog has something annoying in the eye, it is possible that being scratched injures more, for what this should be impeded. Neither you should try to remove what bothers him but taking it to the veterinarian who will know how to make it without hurting. <br><br><u><b>Ingestion of objects:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dog has ingested something that is blocked in the throat, do not try to cause the vomit to take away this object because a worse damage can be caused. Take the dog immediately to the veterinarian. <br><br><u><b>Poisoning:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each poison comes accompanied by different symptoms, but the most common are miscordination, diarrhea or severe vomit, convulse, delirium and even collapse. If the dog presents some, it should be taken to the veterinarian or the Toxicology service. To give the right treatment it should be known what poison the dog ingested. If the veterinarian doesn�t request it, the vomit should not be induced because it can cause a more serious damage. It would help if you have the bottle of the poison. <br><br><u><b>Shock:</b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the body reacts before something serious, the watering of blood diminishes in the brain and in other vital organs, putting the organism in danger. The rhythm of the heart accelerates, the same as the breathing, and the gums become cold and they lose redness. <br>  When this happens the paws of behind should be taken to the head of the animal and it should be sheltered and driven to the veterinarian. </P>

The third one will be sent to you approximately two (2) days before the final deadline of the activity and the second one will be sent approximately between the last two. An approximate example due to the time changes between your place of residence and the place where the system operates (United States), supposing that you must go to an optometry control the 25\u00B4th of August and you defined an anticipation of twenty (20) days the system will work as follows\: <UL><LI> First mail\:             August 5 </LI><LI> Second mail\:         August 14 </LI><LI> Third mail\:              August 23 </LI></UL><p align \="justify"> None the less, if for some reason you want to receive only one (1) mail for the activity or group of them, you can mark "2" in the respective box and the system will only send you the corresponsive reminder with two (2) days of anticipation.
